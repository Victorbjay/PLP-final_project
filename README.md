## 🎯 Project Purpose
This multi-page website showcases my work as a **full-stack developer, designer, and former gemologist**.  
It serves as a personal portfolio, a contact point for potential clients or employers, and a space to highlight selected photography and imagery.

## 🗂️ Site Structure & User Journey
The site consists of **5 responsive pages**, all sharing a consistent header, footer, and navigation:

1. **Home** – Hero section with call-to-action and overview of services.
2. **About** – Biography, skills, and professional background.
3. **Projects / Services** – Grid of featured projects with hover animations.
4. **Photo Gallery** – Curated high-resolution images of workspaces, gemstones, and landscapes.
5. **Contact** – Custom JavaScript-validated form for direct communication.

Navigation is accessible on every page via a sticky top bar, a mobile hamburger menu, and a **dark/light theme toggle**.
